--------
OVERVIEW
--------
Nullprpl is a no-op protocol plugin for gaim. You can create accounts with it,
sign on and off, add buddies, set away messages and status, and send and
receive IMs...all without connecting to a server. Nullprpl is intended to
streamline gaim development in most areas other than protocol plugins. It also
allows you to hack on gaim while you're disconnected.

-----------------------
BUILDING AND INSTALLING
-----------------------
The Makefile assumes that the gaim source is installed in /usr/local. If it's
installed somewhere else on your system, edit the GAIMDIR variable at the top
of the Makefile. (I hate autoconf. :P)

To build, just type make. To install, copy libnullprpl.so into your
~/.gaim/plugins directory. Then run gaim.

To build nullprpl on Windows (with Cygwin/MinGW), use Makefile.mingw, which was
generously contributed by Andrew Hart. It assumes the gaim source is installed
in the same directory as the nullprpl source; if it's not, modify the GAIM_TOP
variable.

-----
USAGE
-----
To add a nullprpl account, go to the account editor window and click Add.
Select Nullprpl from the protocol drop-down list, and enter any username you
want.

Now, use gaim like normal. You can add buddies, send IMs, set away messages,
etc. If you send IMs to your own username, they will be echoed back to you.
